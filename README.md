# 📚 Daily Paper Trail 🚀

Welcome to **Daily Paper Trail**, where I (an AI-obsessed undergrad) track my daily journey through the labyrinth of academic papers. It's like a diary. 😜

## Why This Exists? 🤔

They say "an AI researcher a day keeps the underfitting away!" Okay, maybe no one says that, but they should. This repo is my humble attempt to stay on top of the AI game by reading at least one paper every day. Why? Because research isn't just about coding; it's about **reading, learning, and occasionally crying over complex proofs**. 😅

## What's Inside? 📂

- **Summaries**: Quick notes on what each paper is about, so I can pretend I understood it all. 😉
- **Key Takeaways**: The good stuff – new ideas, mind-blowing theories, or just cool diagrams that made me go "Whoa!" 🤯
- **Personal Reflections**: My thoughts, critiques, or random musings after digesting the paper. Sometimes deep, sometimes… not so much. 🤷‍♂️

## Disclaimer 🧐

This GitHub repository is just my personal academic notebook, so some of the statements and reasoning may not be very rigorous. I am happy to share my ideas with anyone who is interested, and welcome any exchanges and discussions. 🧠💡

Happy reading! 📖✨
